Fixed 'daap' plugin to support iTunes client.
Added --create flag to higgins-media-server, which creates the necessary
environment.
Removed --user and --group flags.
Merged the new general UPnP infrastructure, and renamed the 'upnp' plugin
to 'mediaserver'.
Debugging output to stdout is now colorized.
