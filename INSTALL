Building From Subversion
========================

Building higgins from subversion requires an extra step compared to building
from a distribution archive (two if you count installing extra tools).
In order to build higgins from subversion, first you will need to have
automake and autoconf installed.  Next run the 'autogen.sh' script in the
top directory:

$ ./autogen.sh

This will generate the 'configure' script.

Configuring Your Build
======================

At this point you should have a 'configure' script in the top directory.
Run the configure script to generate any built sources and the Makefiles
which will be used to build and install the application:

$ ./configure

'configure' accepts a number of command-line arguments, which you can see
by passing the '--help' flag:

$ ./configure --help
... [lots of help text]...

The relevant flags for higgins are '--prefix', '--bindir',
'--localstatedir', '--datadir'.

'--prefix' is very handy if you want to experiment with higgins; it lets
you set the path prefix to all installed files and directories.  Thus if
you set '--prefix=/home/msfrank/local' the higgins program would be
installed in /home/msfrank/local/bin/higgins-media-server, higgins data
would be stored in /home/msfrank/local/share,
